This is the same old Tardis, but with plans to be rebuilt on Django framework.

Tardis tool allows to calculate time passed from a certain date within a few clicks. Just paste the date into the field, choose time zone ( by default, EST is chosen) and click "Submit". The result will appear on  screen.

Thanks to dateutil module, most of the date formats are parsed automatically without need to enter anything manually.

Currently, the following time zones are supported: EST, UTC, EEST, IST. ( if need be any additional time zones can be added).
